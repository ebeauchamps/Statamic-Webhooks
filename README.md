# Webhooks for Statamic

Need a way to do something like clearing your cache after deploying? Do it automatically!

After deployment, just hit the following URL:

    http://yoursite.com/TRIGGER/webhooks/go

Your cache will be cleared.

If you have suggestions or requests for other things to be performed automatically, [let me know on Twitter (@jason_varga)](https://twitter.com/jason_varga) or open a GitHub issue.
